# Cozy Couch

## Purpose
A place for users to store info on various media they are interacting with (including books, TV shows, movies, and games), and to see what other users are into.

## How it Works
When the user wants to add a new item, the appropriate API will be queried, and the object returned will be added to the correct shelf/table. Over time, as trends appear and develop, a top item in each category will be recognized, and these will all be pushed to a poster that shows the most common of each type.
